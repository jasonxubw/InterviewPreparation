Question:
You are given a set of words (w1,w2,....,wk) which occur in a certain document D and for each word an associated position list which is an sorted integer array of positions at which that word occurs in D, 
you need to find smallest range in thdocument which contains all the words at least once.

Example input:
W1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26]
W2: [0, 3, 9, 12, 20]
W3: [5, 18, 22, 30]

The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from word 1's list, 20 from word 2's list, and 22 from word 3's list.
